## What is Staking
Staking in the Radix network is essential to protect network security. The Radix network is operated by validator node-runners like StakeSafe who participate in the consensus on transactions and code run on the network.


As an XRD staker you delegate your tokens to validator node-runners and instantly receive rewards for your participation of making the network safe. Its therefore essential to choose your validators wisely since because in case a validator does not perform up to standard, your stake (rewards) might be penalized for incorrect consensus or downtime.
